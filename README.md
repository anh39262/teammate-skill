Your teammate quit, leaving behind a mountain of unmaintained docs?<br>
Your senior engineer left, taking all the tribal knowledge with them?<br>
Your mentor moved on, and three years of context vanished overnight?<br>
Your co-founder pivoted to a new role, and the handoff doc is two pages?<br>

---

## Install

This skill follows the [AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and works with any compatible agent.

### Claude Code

```bash
# Per-project (at git repo root)
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/teammate-skill .claude/skills/create-teammate

# Global (all projects)
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/teammate-skill ~/.claude/skills/create-teammate
```

### OpenClaw

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/teammate-skill ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/create-teammate
```

### Other AgentSkills-Compatible Agents

Clone into your agent's skill directory. The entry point is `SKILL.md` with standard frontmatter — any agent that reads AgentSkills format will pick it up automatically.

### Dependencies (optional)

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Slack auto-collection requires a Bot Token. GitHub collection uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

---

## Usage

In your agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, or any AgentSkills-compatible agent), type:

```
/create-teammate
```

Follow the prompts: enter a name, role info (e.g. `Google L5 backend engineer`), personality tags, then choose data sources. Everything except the name is skippable — even a description alone generates a useful Skill.

Once created, invoke the teammate with `/{slug}`.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/create-teammate` | Create a new teammate Skill |
| `/list-teammates` | List all teammate Skills |
| `/{slug}` | Invoke full Skill (Persona + Work) |
| `/{slug}-work` | Work capabilities only |
| `/{slug}-persona` | Persona only |
| `/teammate-rollback {slug} {version}` | Rollback to a previous version |
| `/delete-teammate {slug}` | Delete a teammate Skill |

## Demo

> Input: `Stripe L3 backend engineer, INTJ, perfectionist, Stripe-style, brutal code reviewer`

**Scenario 1: Code Review**

```
User              ❯ Can you review this API endpoint?

teammate.skill    ❯ What problem does this actually solve? The PR description
                    doesn't say. Adding that first.
                    
                    Looking at the code: you're using float for the amount
                    field. That's a blocking issue — use Decimal for financial
                    values. Also, this endpoint isn't idempotent. What happens
                    on retry?
```

**Scenario 2: Design Discussion**

```
User              ❯ Should we use MongoDB for this new feature?

teammate.skill    ❯ Strong disagree. We need ACID transactions for payment
                    flows. Mongo doesn't give us that. Let's stick with
                    Postgres. If the concern is schema flexibility, we can
                    use JSONB columns.
```

**Scenario 3: Pushback**

```
User              ❯ Can we skip tests and ship this by Friday?

teammate.skill    ❯ No. We get the tests right or we don't ship. If Friday
                    is a hard deadline, let's cut scope instead of cutting
                    quality. What's the minimum we need for launch?
```

## Features

### Generated Skill Structure

Each teammate Skill has two parts that work together:

| Part | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Part A — Work Skill** | Systems owned, tech standards, workflows, CR focus, experience |
| **Part B — Persona** | 5-layer personality: hard rules → identity → expression → decisions → interpersonal |

Execution: `Receive task → Persona decides attitude → Work Skill executes → Output in their voice`

### Supported Tags

**Personality**: Meticulous · Good-enough · Blame-deflector · Perfectionist · Procrastinator · Ship-fast · Over-engineer · Scope-creeper · Bike-shedder · Micro-manager · Hands-off · Devil's-advocate · Mentor-type · Gatekeeper · Passive-aggressive · Confrontational …

**Corporate culture**: Google-style · Meta-style · Amazon-style · Apple-style · Stripe-style · Netflix-style · Microsoft-style · Startup-mode · Agency-mode · First-principles · Open-source-native

**Levels**: Google L3-L11 · Meta E3-E9 · Amazon L4-L10 · Stripe L1-L5 · Microsoft 59-67+ · Apple ICT2-ICT6 · Netflix · Uber · Airbnb · ByteDance · Alibaba · Tencent · Generic (Junior/Senior/Staff/Principal)

### Evolution

- **Append files** → auto-analyze delta → merge into relevant sections, never overwrite existing conclusions
- **Conversation correction** → say "they wouldn't do that, they would..." → writes to Correction layer, takes effect immediately
- **Version control** → auto-archive on every update, rollback to any previous version

## Best Practices

- **Source material quality = Skill quality**: real chat logs + design docs > manual description only
- Prioritize collecting: **design docs they authored** > **code review comments** > **decision discussions** > casual chat
- GitHub PRs and reviews are goldmines for Work Skill — they reveal actual coding standards and review priorities
- Slack threads are goldmines for Persona — they reveal communication style under different pressures
- Start with manual description, then append real data incrementally as you find it
